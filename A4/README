How to run the program:
-----------------------
- From the root directory, run "npm install" in the terminal
- cd to the "parser" folder and run "make" to compile the GEDCOMparser files
- From the root directory, run "npm run dev portNum", where portNum is the port number
- Open a browser and type "localhost:portNum" in the searchbar to run the program


Limitations:
------------
- The program MAY crash when dealing with some files(especially shakespeare.ged). I was unable to fix this problem, but restarting
  the server usually works
- I used the body-parser module of the express package which was provided for us, and it seems to be 
  depreceated in the version of Node that we are required to use, so there may be warnings when the 
  server is started.
