    This project was a team school project I undertook with 4 other team members. The task was to upgrade 
an existing open-source android project i.e make it better and more user-friendly. The aim was to learn 
and practice Agile development teamwork practices. The project we chose was called EPISODES. This app 
allowed users to search for and save TV shows, and keep track of episodes that been watched. We added a few 
new features like sorting, filtering, adding reviews, starring, displaying more info about the shows, etc.
